## 1) Introduction 
- The wine dataset download from https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/playground-series-s3e5/data?select=sample_submission.csv

- Nowadays, wine is being enjoyed by an increasing number of consumers. In order to safeguard human health, wine certification and quality assessment are the key elements. Certification prevents illegal wine adulteration and ensures quality in the wine market. Quality assessment is usually part of the certification process and can be used to improve the winemaking and to stratify wines, such as premium brands.
- <b> Wine certification </b> is usually assessed through physicochemical and organoleptic tests. The physicochemical laboratory tests typically used to characterize wines include the determination of density, alcohol concentration or pH, while sensory testing relies heavily on human experts.
- Since taste is the most difficult of the human senses to understand and difficult to sample data for experiments, in this study we first used data from physicochemical laboratory tests and predicted wine quality from them.
- <b> Wine quality prediction </b> is the process of using data analysis and machine learning techniques to predict wine quality based on various factors, such as...<br>

### 1.1) Objective / Purpose
i. To <b> visualize </b> the statistical information of the wine dataset. <br>
ii. To <b> analyze </b> the certainty of the data occurance probability. <br>
iii.  To <b> represent </b> the distribution of data in numerical and continuous. <br>
iv.  To <b> represent </b> the distribution of data in numerical and continuous. <br>
v. To <b> determine </b> the most and the least important features that contribute to the quality of wine. <br><br>

## 2) Dataset Description
In this dataset, we are going to analyze <span style="color:#FF7F7F;">__12 attributes__</span> and <span style="color:#FF7F7F;">__2,056 sets of data__</span>. These features are...

|Attributes|Description|
|:-:|:--|
|**Fixed_Acidity**| The amount of acid in the wine that is not volatile and does not evaporate.|
|**Volatile_Acidity**| The amount of acid in the wine that is volatile and can evaporate.|
|**Citric_Acid**| Natural organic weak acid extracted in wine.<br>|
|**Residual_Sugar**| The amount of sugar remaining in the wine after fermentation.<br>|
|**Chlorides**| The amount of salt in the wine.<br>|
|**Free_Sulfur_Dioxide**| The amount of sulfur dioxide present in the wine that is not bound to other molecules, which is a protection from them.<br>|
|**Total_Sulfur_Dioxide**| The total amount of sulfur dioxide present in the wine.<br>|
|**Density**| The density of the wine.<br>|
|**pH**| The level of acidity or alkaline in the wine.<br>|
|**Sulphates**| The amount of sulphates in the wine, which is a protection from oxidation and bacteria.<br>|
|**Alcohol**| The percentage of alcohol in the wine.<br>|
|**Quality**| The sensory quality of the wine, which is typically rated on a scale from 3 to 8. <br>|
